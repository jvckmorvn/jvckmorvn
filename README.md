## Hi, I'm Jack. 👋
I'm a `full-stack developer` mainly working in Rails, with a pinch of Stimulus.  
I'm currently working on a personal project inspired by the work of [Audrey Tang](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/audrey-tang-what-we-can-learn-from-taiwan/) which aims to make various policies of major UK parties more transparent and engaging for the general public.  
I also contribute to a handful of other more light-hearted projects with friends. 🥳  
Besides coding, I also enjoy:  
📚 reading  
🌶️ spicy foods  
🎸 guitar  
🎧 [music production](https://www.jvckmorvn.com/)  
My inbox is always open for new ideas and opportunities to collaborate; shoot me a message about what you're doing and let's see if I can help! 🚀
