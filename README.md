## Hi, I'm Jack 👋
I'm a `full-stack developer` mainly working in Rails, with a pinch of Stimulus.
I'm currently working on a project inspired by the work of Audrey Tang which aims to make the various policies of major UK parties more transparent and engaging for the general public. I do also dabble in a handful of other personal projects just for fun. 🥳 
My inbox is always open for new ideas and opportunities to collaborate!
Besides coding, I also enjoy:
📚 reading 
🌶️ spicy foods
🎸 guitar
🎧 music production
Shoot me a message about what you're doing and let's see if I can help! 🚀
