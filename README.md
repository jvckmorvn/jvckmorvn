### Hi, I'm Jack 👋
I'm a `full-stack developer` mainly working in Rails, with a pinch of Stimulus.  
I'm currently working on a project inspired by the work of <a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/audrey-tang-what-we-can-learn-from-taiwan/" target="_blank">Audrey Tang</a> which aims to make the various policies of major UK parties more transparent and engaging for the general public.  
I also dabble in a handful of other personal projects just for fun. 🥳  
Besides coding, I also enjoy:  
📚 reading  
🌶️ spicy foods  
🎸 guitar  
🎧 <a href="https://www.jvckmorvn.com/" target="_blank">music production</a>  
My inbox is always open for new ideas and opportunities to collaborate; shoot me a message about what you're doing and let's see if I can help! 🚀
