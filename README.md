## Hi, I'm Jack. 👋
I'm a `full-stack developer` working primarily in Rails, with a pinch of Stimulus.  
I'm currently working on a handful of personal projects with friends, and teaching myself React. 🌱  
Besides coding, I also enjoy:  
📚 reading  
🌶️ spicy foods  
🎸 guitar  
🎧 [music production](https://www.jvckmorvn.com/)  
My inbox is always open for new ideas and opportunities to collaborate; shoot me a message about what you're doing and let's see if I can help! 🚀
